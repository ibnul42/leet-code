# 1. Two Sum

###### Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

###### You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

###### You can return the answer in any order.

# 27. Remove Element

###### Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.

###### Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

###### Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

###### Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

###### Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

###### Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

###### Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

###### Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

# 9. Palindrome Number

###### Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

###### An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

###### For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

# 69. Sqrt(x)

###### Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

###### Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

###### Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as pow(x, 0.5) or x \*\* 0.5.

# 58. Length of Last Word

###### Given a string s consisting of some words separated by some number of spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

###### A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

# 28. Implement strStr()

###### Implement strStr().

###### Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

###### Clarification:

###### What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

###### For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

# 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

###### Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.

###### In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

# 66. Plus One

###### You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

###### Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

# 7. Reverse Integer

###### Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

###### Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

# 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array

###### Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

###### Return the running sum of nums.

# 724. Find Pivot Index

###### Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.

###### The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.

###### If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.

###### Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.

# 205. Isomorphic Strings

###### Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

###### Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

###### All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

# 392. Is Subsequence

###### A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
